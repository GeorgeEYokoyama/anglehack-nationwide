# NaviGarden

## App Description

NaviGarden is a web application that assists millenial home buyers in navigating the complex chore of home buying, preparing them to be responsible home buyers. With a simple web browser, your typical millenial can input their financial data, visualize nearby homes they can afford, and make responsible decisions on purchasing their first home. 

## Design Elements 



# Front end

To install dependencies for Vue.js, write

`npm install`

from inside the *client* directory, and in the same directory, write

`npm run build`

in the terminal. This will allow the web application to be available for viewing in our server in `main.py`, which can be accessed via

`python main.py`

In the *backend* directory.

## API's used:

+ We used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for implementing a front-end web application, which (George/Lorman add why we used this)

## How does it work?

## Features

# Back end

+ [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a microframework that acts as our server to deploy the web application. Flask implements bare minimum requirements with simplicity, flexibility, and fine-grained control. 

+ [Flask CORS](http://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a way to meet security settings to connect your back-end to your front-end.

+ [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) allows us to do HTTP requests to serve our backend to Flask.

+ [xmljson](https://pypi.org/project/xmljson/) parses XML files into JSON objects to parse response text from the Zillow API
